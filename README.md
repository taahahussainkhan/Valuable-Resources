## 1 - [Github Directory Downloader](https://download-directory.github.io/)

    The website [Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/) allows users to download a specific folder from a GitHub repository by entering the URL of the repository and      the folder they want to download. The website processes the URL and generates a ZIP file containing all the files in the folder, which can be downloaded and unzipped on the user's        computer. This is a convenient way to download a specific folder from a GitHub repository without having to clone the entire repository or use third-party tools.
